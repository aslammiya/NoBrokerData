# 🏡 Proposal: Real Estate Listings Dataset from NoBroker.in (India)

### 📌 Overview
This is a **data acquisition proposal** for structured real estate listings from [NoBroker.in](https://www.nobroker.in), one of India's leading property platforms. The goal is to deliver property listings across India (or from specific localities if required), formatted to match the standardized **REAL-ESTATE-BASIC schema** provided by **Data Boutique**.

No code or scraper has been built yet — this is a project proposal to initiate the conversation and align on data expectations.
